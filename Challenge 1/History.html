<h1>History</h1>
<hr>
<p>History(from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek"
target ="blank">
Greek</a> means to inquiry or "knowledge 
acquired by investigation")</p>

<p>Events before the invention of writing systems 
are considered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prehistory"
target="blank">prehistory</a>. "History" is an umbrella 
term comprising past events as well as the memory, 
discovery, collection, organization, presentation, 
and interpretation of these events. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historian"
target="blank">Historians</a> seek 
knowledge of the past using historical sources such 
as written documents, oral accounts, art and material 
artifacts, and ecological markers.</p>

<p>History is also an <a href=
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_discipline" 
target="blank">academic discipline </a>which uses 
narrative to describe, examine, question, and analyze 
past events, and investigate their patterns of cause 
and effect. Historians often debate which 
narrative best explains an event, as well as the 
significance of different causes and effects. 
Historians also debate the nature of history as an
 end in itself, as well as its usefulness to give 
perspective on the problems of the present.</p>

<p>Stories common to a particular culture, but not
 supported by external sources (such as the tales 
surrounding King Arthur), are usually classified as 
cultural heritage or legends. History differs
 from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myth"
target="blink">myth</a> in that it is supported by evidence. 
However, ancient cultural influences have helped 
spawn variant <a href=
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpretation_(logic)"
target="blank">interpretations</a> of the nature of history
 which have evolved over the centuries and continue 
to change today. The modern study of history is 
wide-ranging, and includes the study of specific 
regions and the study of certain topical or thematic
 elements of historical investigation. History is 
often taught as part of primary and secondary 
education, and the academic study of history is a 
major discipline in university studies.

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herodotus"
target="blank">Herodotus</a>, a 5th-century BC 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellenic_historiography"
target="blank">Greek historian</a>, is 
often considered the "father of history" in the 
Western tradition, although he has also been 
criticized as the "father of lies". Along 
with his contemporary Thucydides, he helped form
 the foundations for the modern study of past 
events and societies. Their works continue to be 
read today, and the gap between the culture-
focused Herodotus and the military-focused 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thucydides"
target="blank">Thucydides</a> remains a point of contention or 
approach in modern historical writing. In East
 Asia, a state chronicle, the <a href=
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_and_Autumn_Annals"
target="blank">Spring and 
Autumn Annals</a>, was reputed to date from as 
early as 722 BC, although only 2nd-century 
BC texts have survived.</p>
